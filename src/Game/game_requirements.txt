STYLING & UI
Theme: Dark Mode (Grays with Blue accent colors).
Implementation: SCSS Modules only (no Tailwind or external CSS frameworks).
Responsiveness: Fully responsive layout for Mobile and Desktop.

Layout Order:
15x15 Game Board, on desktop on the left, full height, on mobile on the top, full width
Player Scoreboard (2-4 players side-by-side, Name above Score). On Desktop, top of right side, on Mobile, below board.
Interaction Area (Turn Gate, Tile Rack, and Action Buttons). Below player scoreboard.

DATA & STATE MANAGEMENT
Props: Receives an array of player objects.
Context: Dictionary data (word-to-multiplier mapping) provided via React Context.
Initialization: Starting player is selected randomly at the beginning of the game.
Tile Pool: Standard Scrabble distribution. Racks are refilled to 7 tiles from the pool upon turn completion.

BOARD & INPUT LOGIC
Board Grid: 15x15 squares with standard bonus colors (DL, TL, DW, TW).

Interaction:
Click 1 on a square: Selects square and sets direction to "Across", or the direction of the
  previously active tile.
Click 2 on the same square: Toggles direction.
UI Indicator: A triangular arrow displays at the active square showing direction.

Tile Placement:
Keyboard: Typing a letter places it if it exists in the rack.
Click: Clicking a tile in the rack places it into the active board square.
Auto-advance: The cursor advances in the active direction after a tile is placed.

Backspace:
If the active square is empty, select the square one space opposite of the selected direction.
If the active square contains a tile that has been played on the current turn, return that tile to the player's rack and take it off the board. Also perform the action in step one.
If the active square contains a tile that was not played on the current turn, don't take the tile off the board but still move selection opposite.

Blank Tiles:
Used automatically if the typed letter is missing from the rack but a blank is available.
If clicked manually in the rack, a prompt allows the user to designate the letter.
Visuals: Blanks show the designated letter in light gray with no point value.

TURN FLOW & MECHANICS
Turn Gate: Before a rack is shown, display "[Player Name] Ready?" and a "Ready" button.

Exchange Mode:
Activated via "Exchange" button.
UI Toggle: "Submit" becomes "Confirm Exchange"; "Exchange" becomes "Cancel".
User selects tiles to return to the pool and receives new ones.

Validation:
Real-time check: Every placement triggers a dictionary and connectivity check.
Connectivity: Words must connect to existing tiles (except the first move, which must touch the center).
Dictionary: Every word formed (primary and hooks) must exist in the dictionary.
Submit Button: Disabled if any formed word is invalid or if the play is disconnected.

SCORING & WIN CONDITIONS
Scoring Logic:
Follows standard Scrabble letter and board multiplier rules.
Dictionary Multiplier: Each individual word score is multiplied by the multiplier value associated with that word in the CSV.
Total Move Score = Sum of all individual word scores (Score * Multiplier).
Visual Feedback: The current move's score is displayed in a small circle at the end/bottom of the word string.

Game End:
Occurs when a player empties their rack and the pool is empty.
Final Adjustment: The finisher gains the value of all opponents' remaining tiles; opponents subtract their own remaining tile values.
